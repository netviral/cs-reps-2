#### 1. Weekly Office Hours

Our weekly office hours are held **every Monday from 9–10 PM**.  
An announcement email will be sent out each week with any updates or changes — timings may occasionally shift based on exams or department events. 

Feel free to drop in with questions about courses, faculty, department processes, academic concerns, or anything else we can help with. You are also welcome to reach out to us for separate Office Hours for additional/urgent queries!
